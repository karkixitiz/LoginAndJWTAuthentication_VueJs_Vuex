# LoginAndJWTAuthentication_VueJs_Vuex

> A Vue.js project. In this project I'm trying to implement the basic features of Vuex i.e. state, actions, getters, mutations etc. The structure of project might not be organize but I always curious about how state management pattern work?, how component dispatch action ? how action commit mutations? and how to use other library helper classes like ...mapAction, ...mapState etc. In this project, I'm not using any database server but localstore exist.   

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
